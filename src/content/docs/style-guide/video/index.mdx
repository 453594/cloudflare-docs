## Introduction

These video guidelines are to help Cloudflare’s staff members and external contributors in the production of Cloudflare videos. They will help you create footage that is high quality, consistent, and reflects Cloudflare’s identity and communications.

The videos our team produces and distributes are not meant to replace developer documentation, regardless of whether a user accesses a video via social media, on the developer documentation website, or in the Cloudflare dashboard. Rather, the goal of the Cloudflare Video team is to produce videos that enhance our written content and dashboard experiences.

## Video Guiding Principles:
- **Videos should look/feel/be...** (think: tone, overarching style)
- **Videos should help a user by...**
- **Videos should enhance other content by...**

## Technical Video Specifications

This section describes the quality, format and properties of Cloudflare videos, such as resolution, bitrate and color grading.

### Video Quality

#### Resolution

Videos should be recorded at a minimum of 3840x2160 resolution (4K) and exported at a minimum of 1080p full HD quality. No footage below 1080p will be used.

- **Acceptable resolutions:**
  - **1080p (Full HD)**: 1920 x 1080 pixels
  - **1440p (2K QHD)**: 2560 x 1440 pixels
  - **2160p (4K UHD)**: 3840 x 2160 pixels
- **Unacceptable resolutions:**
  - **480p**: 720 x 480 pixels
  - **720p (HD)**: 1280 x 720 pixels

#### Screen Recordings

Screen recordings should be done on the largest monitor possible, with the highest resolution available to the recording software. Ensure that any text visible on your screen is large enough that it can be easily read in the final video. 

Note: you may need to modify the zoom of the window you are recording or your monitor’s resolution.

#### Frame Rate

25 frames per second (FPS).

#### Bitrate
Footage should be recorded in the highest possible bitrate available. This will allow for better color, detail, and video quality in the final product.

#### Picture Profiles

S-Cinetone is standard. Use the most natural in-camera color and saturation.

### Aspect Ratios

Aspect ratio is important for the viewing experience. The more a video fills the screen, the more immersive an experience it provides.

#### Desktop Aspect Ratio

The most common screens and online platforms, such as YouTube and Vimeo, use a 16:9 ratio, so the majority of videos should be produced in a 16:9 ratio.

#### Mobile Aspect Ratio

Social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook are typically accessed on mobile devices, and usually require a 1:1 aspect ratio.

### Color Grading

Final videos should be graded to natural colors, not over/under saturated or too heavily influenced in one color direction. Different skin tones, lighting situations, and preferences for the “vibe" will influence the settings.

### Audio

#### Background Noise

Avoid locations with background noise.

#### Echo

Echo is extremely difficult to remove in post-production. Test for echoes by clapping and listening for a "dampened" sound. Best practice is avoid large empty rooms, but if you must, soundproof your recording area by introducing sound-absorbing materials such as carpets, curtains, blankets, or foam panels.

#### Microphone Placement

- **Shotgun microphones**: Place the microphone over your head, just outside of the frame.
- **Lavalier microphones**: Lavalier microphones may be visible, but cords and cables should be hidden.

## Video Branding Guidelines

### Logo Usage, Fonts, and Color Palette

For Cloudflare video contributors, check our branding guidelines [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/FYnURhxtrmhMG2z60kLeoh/Brand-Design-Guidelines-%2723?page-id=1013%3A1410&type=design&node-id=1140-1812&t=n6tugqnuuZqU3IFl-0&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1140%3A1812&hide-ui=1).

### Intro and Outro

Use chapter separators when applicable, such as:
- Steps in tutorials
- Different concepts explained
- Different functions

Limit chapter separators to no more than one transition per 3-4 minutes.

### Transitions, Overlays, and Effects

- Should be used with moderation.
- Must be subtle and justifiable.
- Should not alter the overall look and feel of the video.

### On-Screen Audiovisual Content

Ensure permission is given to use video assets like overlays, stock footage, audio, graphics, etc., and include appropriate attribution. Document provided licenses as needed.

### Subtitles

In general, we rely on platform automatic subtitle generation (e.g., YouTube, Stream).

#### Subtitle Specifications

- Subtitles are always published in English in SubRip format (.srt).
- Max 45 characters per line, split over 2 lines, and no longer than 10 seconds per subtitle.

### Lower Thirds

Contact the Cloudflare Video team for the most up-to-date lower thirds and chapter files.

## Video Tone

### Presenter Frame, Look and Feel

Frame yourself in the center, with some distance from the wall behind you. Maintain eyeline directly towards the lens and avoid reflections on your glasses.

### Dress Code

- Smart casual tops (e.g., T-shirt (preferably a Cloudflare t-shirt), polo, casual shirt, sweater).
- Solid and jewel tones (e.g., dark orange, emerald green, navy, burgundy). 
- Avoid distracting patterns, accessories or flashy jewelry.
- Avoid non-affiliated branded clothing, especially non-open source companies.

### Room Atmosphere

- **Option A**: Choose a location with natural light and minimal echo. Set up additional lights if necessary.
- **Option B**: Configure a green screen. Having appropriate lighting, with minimal shadows, is extremely important. 

### Thumbnail Picture

Thumbnails should be clear still images of the presenter. Avoid motion blur or exaggerated facial expressions. Ensure the title text is readable.

### Adding Audio

Cloudflare Video will review and edit all audio submissions, including background music and sound effects. 

#### Music

- Music should be about 20dB lower than speaking volume.
- Background music must be instrumental.
